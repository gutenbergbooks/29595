<h2>LITTLE MOTHER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Kitty's mother called her
little daughter to her, and taking both
her dimpled dots of hands in her
own soft white ones, said, "Kitty, my
darling, I am going to New York this
morning, to see your dear grandma',
and I shall have to leave the house in
your charge until I come back. Do
you think you can be my little housekeeper
for to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, mamma! I should like
that so much! I will keep house as
well as you&mdash;that is, 'most, not quite!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and Kitty jumped up and down for joy
at being trusted with such important
affairs.</p>

<p>"You must take care of dear little
Luly and Walter, you know; see that
they have their dinners fixed right,
and go out walking with them and
nurse; and if any company comes,
you must go down and see them, and
say that mamma has gone to New
York, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma; I will be just as
good as pie!" said Kitty, earnestly;
"Luly and Wawa will like to have me
for a mother, I guess."</p>

<p>"Yes; you are their Little Mother
for to-day," said her mamma. "I
know you love me, Kitty, and want to
save me all the trouble you can; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
will be a great comfort to me, while I
am away, to feel that I can trust you
perfectly;" and she kissed the little,
rosy cheek, I'm sure I can't tell how
many times, and Kitty felt so proud
and happy that she only wished she
had been trusted with a much larger
family of little brothers and sisters, instead
of two; that she might show the
more what an excellent Little Mother
she intended to be. You would wish
so too, wouldn't you! yes, of course!</p>

<p>Kitty May lived with her papa and
mamma, Luly and Walter, Mary the
nurse, and Betty the cook, three
brown horses, two red cows, a black
dog, and a white kitten, at a beautiful
country seat up the Hudson River.
She was only eight years old, but her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
obedience to her parents, and tender,
loving care of her little brother and
sister, were beautiful to see, and a
shining example to some little girls I
know. On the day that I am telling
you about, her papa had gone to town,
as usual, early in the morning, and
now here was mamma going too, and
Kitty would be left to play lady of the
house as grand as anything.</p>

<p>Well, the carriage was brought to
the door, and mamma got in, after
kissing her little family all round
about twenty times. Everybody
rushed to the front piazza to bid her
good-by in their own fashion. Trip,
the black dog, jumped and barked
around the horses, until they nearly
kicked him, when he sprang away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
snapping out, "No, you don't! no,
you don't!" Dody, the white kitten,
so called by Walter for "Daisy,"
mewed as hard as she could from
Luly's arms. Walter crowed and
chuckled, and said, "Boo-bi!" meaning
good-by; Luly lisped, "Dood-by, dear
mamma, <i>div</i> my <i>yove</i> to gan'ma;" and
Kitty said, "Good-by, mamma; I'll
be a famous Little Mother&mdash;see if I'm
not!" And so the carriage drove
away.</p>

<p>When it was quite out of sight, the
little girls skipped and climbed, and
wee Walter was carried by nurse up
stairs into the nursery; and Kitty said,
"Now, Mary, you can just go on with
your sewing; you needn't mind us a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
bit. I'm going to take care of <i>the
children;</i> mamma said so."</p>

<p>"Very well, Miss Kitty," said
Mary; "I'll sit in the window here,
and if you want me, you can call."</p>

<p>So Mary fixed little Walter in his
chair, and Luly got hers, and Kitty sat
down in her mamma's rocking chair,
to be grander.</p>

<p>Walter's chair had a little tray fastened
before it, on which his toys were
put. His dearest plaything was a ridiculous
old doll, with no eyes, half a
wig, such a dilapidated pair of kid
arms that the stuffing came bursting
through in every direction, making
her look as if she had a cotton plantation
inside her, and the bolls were
sprouting out; and such an extremely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
short pair of legs in proportion to her
body, that it seemed as if they must
shut into her like a pair of telescopes.
Besides this, there was a stale sugar
peacock without a tail, a monkey that
ran up and down a stick, and a woolly
dog that could open his mouth and
bark when you pressed him underneath;
but the doll was the prime favorite,
after all. Walter called her
Gawow, and as nobody in the house
could imagine what he meant by it, it
was supposed to be a pure piece of invention,
and a very fine sort of thing.</p>

<p>The children played on peaceably
together for some time, when all at
once there came a ring at the bell.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" cried Kitty, springing
up and smoothing down her little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
black silk apron in a great flurry.
"There comes company, and I'm to
go and see them."</p>

<p>"Ou!" said Luly; "me want to
see tompany too!"</p>

<p>"And so you shall, you little darling!"
said Kitty, kissing her; and,
sure enough, up came Ellen, the waiter,
to say that the good minister, Mr.
Lacy, was down stairs; for Mrs. May
had smilingly told her, before she
went, that "Miss Kitty would see any
one who called."</p>

<p>In high glee, yet somewhat awed
by her grown-up dignity, Kitty let
Mary brush her soft brown braided
wig and Luly's golden curly one;
then she rushed into her mother's
room in a hurry, called Luly out into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the entry, and the little sisters took
hold of hands and went down stairs to
see the company.</p>

<p>Mr. Lacy was sitting by the window,
looking out on the beautiful garden,
and did not know the children
had entered until he felt a mite of a
hand put softly on his, and heard two
little pipy voices saying, "How do
you do, Mr. Lacy?" The minister
turned round and burst right out
laughing! for Kitty, when she ran
into her mother's room, had put on&mdash;what
do you think?&mdash;why, one of
mamma's caps, which was lying on the
dressing table! and the queer little
thing looked so funny with the lace
cap perched on top of her head, that
Mr. Lacy laughed heartily, and said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
"Why, Kitty! are you the old woman
that lived in a shoe? or have you got
bald all of a sudden, that you have
taken to caps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm Little Mother!" said
Kitty; "mamma has gone to the city,
and left me to take care of <i>the children</i>,
and the house, and Dody, and
Trip, until she comes back; and I'm
Little Mother to all of them."</p>

<p>"Well, Little Mother," said Mr.
Lacy, who was none of your cross,
crabbed old ministers, with faces as
sour as vinegar, and voices as sharp
as a needle, who frighten children half
out of their wits, forgetful that "of
such is the kingdom of heaven;"
"I hope your children will be well
brought up, and learn all they should.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
What does this one know?" lifting
Luly to his knee.</p>

<p>"I know 'ittle hymn," said Luly,
smiling up confidently in his face.</p>

<p>"Can't you say it for me?" asked
the minister. "What is it all about?"</p>

<p>"'Bout 'at a 'ittle child can do,"
lisped Luly.</p>

<p>"Say it, Luly," said Kitty.</p>

<p>Luly folded her cunning fat
hands over each other, and crossed
her feet. Then she looked up sideways
in Mr. Lacy's face, and sucked
her tongue a little bit, and at last, all
at once, in a little singing voice, she
began:</p>

<p>"Ah! that is a beautiful hymn,"
said the good minister. "Don't you
know any, Little Mother?"</p>

<p>"I am learning a beautiful hymn,"
said Kitty, "but I don't know it yet&mdash;not
quite."</p>

<p>"No?" said Mr. Lacy. "Then I
shall have to tell you something myself,
I declare. Here, sit down beside
me, and listen very attentively."</p>

<p>Now, what do you think the minister
told them? "Some dreadful,
dismal story, full of dreadful, wicked
children, who were sent to prison, I
suppose; or an account of how, if <i>they</i>
ever dared to run down stairs, or look
out of the window, or sneeze in church,
on Sundays, they never would get to
Heaven!" perhaps you will say. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a bit of it. He just trotted Luly up
and down on his knee, and told them
these funny verses:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Three little kittens from home ran away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Oh dear! oh dear!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And did you not hear</span><br />
All that befell them on that day?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Did you ever hear, in your life, of such folly!</span><br />
<br />
"Out they ran from their mother's door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And skipped, and tripped,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And danced, and dipped,</span><br />
Way down the road, where they'd ne'er been before!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh deary! what <i>will</i> be the end of their folly?</span><br />
<br />
"'Come let us go into this barn for mice!'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">'Oh don't!' 'Oh stuff!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I'm hungry enough</span><br />
To eat anything that is sav'ry and nice!'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So quoth little Dolly and Poppledy-polly,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While Dilly looked on, quite aghast at their folly!</span><br />
<br />
"So in it they went, quite full of their fun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And stared, and glared,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And meauoed, and scared</span><br />
The poor little mice till they made them all run!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For Dilly, I'm sorry to say, shared their folly.</span><br />
<br />
"But, alas! while the kittens were hunting up mice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And munching, and crunching</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Their smoking-hot <i>lunching</i>,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>Oh!</i> <span class="smcap">oh!</span> OH! what a shocking cli<i>max</i> to their folly!</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, how they struggled and mewed in their fright!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And scratched, and snatched</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">At the dismal old patched</span><br />
Bag they were thrust into, twisted up tight!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I warrant, they felt bad enough for their folly.</span><br />

"Soon to a stranger house they came;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Now, only see <i>thar!</i>'</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Poor Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With Dilly (oh!), and Dolly (oh!), and Poppledy-polly (oh! oh!),</span><br />

<p>The children were very much
amused with this woful history,
bursting out laughing without any
kind of fail when Poppledy-polly, of
comical memory and name, was mentioned.
Luly said, "Oh, me <i>yike</i> that
name! me want to call Dody Popply-polly."
This made Kitty laugh more
than ever, and they had a great time
chasing Dody round the hall, and
catching her, to bawl in her ears
"Poppledy-polly!" by way of kindly
informing her that was to be her new
name.</p>

<p>Dody didn't seem to like it much,
for she jumped out of Luly's arms with
a squeal and a flourish of her long tail,
and scampered off faster than ever
each time. After watching them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
laughing for a while, Mr. Lacy rose to
go, saying:</p>

<p>"Good-by, Little Mother; I must
go and see some of the big mothers
now. Don't forget me on any account,
and tell your mamma, when
she comes home, that I approve your
style of housekeeping very much indeed."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. Lacy," said Kitty.
"Thank you for your funny story."</p>

<p>"Tank 'ou&mdash;funny 'tory!" repeated
Luly after her sister.</p>

<p>Mr. Lacy lifted the little thing up
to his shoulder, and held her there a
minute, saying, "Good-by, Poppledy-polly!
I hope, when I come again,
you will know another hymn to say."</p>

<p>Luly didn't like much to be called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Poppledy-polly, and she said, with an
air of considerable displeasure, "My
name Luly May;" but when the minister
kissed her, and called her "his
little lamb," she relented, and cooed,
"Me <i>yove</i> 'ou, miniter!'</p>

<p>Then something quite sorrowful
happened; for two great tears gathered
in the minister's eyes, and came
slowly rolling down his kind face.
Ah! he thought of his own little pet
lamb, who once lisped, too, "Me yove
'ou;" who said so now to the dear Jesus;
and with that last thought came
comfort. Floy was only "sleeping"&mdash;and
setting little Luly gently down,
Mr. Lacy laid a hand on each childish
head, saying, "God bless you, my little
lambs," and went quietly away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
The children watched him drive off,
and then capturing Dody once more&mdash;by
the end of her tail this time&mdash;Kitty
popped her in her apron; and lugged
her up stairs in triumph.</p>

<p>There they found Wawa, sitting on
the floor, with an immense pair of scissors
held in both hands, and an expression
of extreme horror on his face.
Mary had left the room, and Kitty,
running up to her baby brother, pulled
away the scissors in a great fright,
exclaiming, "Why, Wawa! where did
you get those?"</p>

<p>Wawa stared astonished for a
moment, his great blue eyes opened
very wide indeed; then he bubbled
out, "On yer fore (floor); yook! Gawow
all poil!" (spoiled); and poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Wawa puckered up his little rosy
mouth, and began to cry most piteously.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="364" height="500" alt="KITTY POPPED HER INTO HER APRON" title="" />
<span class="caption">KITTY POPPED HER INTO HER APRON</span>
</div>

<p>Luly popped on the floor beside
him in a minute, and pulling his curly
head down on her breast, she murmured,
"There&mdash;don't <i>c'y</i>, never <i>matter</i>,
dear <i>bedder</i>&mdash;s'eel get well!" while
Kitty lifted up poor Gawow, who was
indeed in a pitiable condition. Walter
had ornamented her face with several
deep digs of the scissors, which
made her look as if she had been
to the wars and come home with a
number of bullet holes in her. Then,
not satisfied with this&mdash;what does
that monkey Wawa do but rip up
her whole body from the neck to the
waist, and shake out every bit of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
bran all over the carpet! leaving the
wretched Gawow with not the least
particle of insides.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of such a piece
of mischief? But then Walter was
such a little fellow&mdash;not quite two
years old; of course he didn't mean
to do anything wrong, and nobody
thought of blaming him; so Kitty
called Mary to come and sweep up
the bran, and Luly and Walter were
soon happily engaged in stuffing Gawow
with rags, making her look as
good as new&mdash;or as good as old, I
might say; for she was such a direful
object in the first place, that it seemed
as though she must have been bought
in that condition, and never could
have been otherwise; after which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
dressed her in her very best bonnet
and frock, and treated her to a nice
dance in the garden, all taking hold
of hands; until Mary looked out of
the window and called them to come
up to dinner.</p>

<p>Kitty was old enough, now, to dine
with the grown folks, and behaved
like a perfect little lady, too; but on
this occasion she was going to take
early dinner in the nursery.</p>

<p>She and Luly helped Mary pull
out the nursery table, and set the
three little plates upon it. Walter's
dinner was some mashed potato,
with just a tiny mite of chicken among
it, minced very fine, and made into an
elegant hill on his plate, and a "wishing
bone" to suck. Luly had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
same, only with more chicken; and
Kitty cut up her own wing and slice
of breast, with her particular knife
and fork, as nice as you please.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of merriment
over the dinner, when Walter
would look away just as Mary gave
him a spoonful of potato, watching
her out of the corner of his eye,
though, and then bob round again and
say "Feed!" just as she had put it
down, thinking he didn't want any
more. Then he insisted on making
Gawow taste the wishing bone, and
poked it into both her eyes in succession,
as if that was the usual way for
people to eat things. After they had
finished the chicken and potato, they
had some nice custard pudding; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
when dinner was over, Kitty went
right to the wash stand and <i>cleaned
her teeth</i>, while Luly held up her
mouth to have Mary brush her little
pearly teeth. Do you always do this,
little reader? If not, let me beg you
to begin right away. Are they done
now? Very well, then let us go on
with the story.</p>

<p>Pretty soon after, the children
were dressed to go out walking; for
it was in the early spring time when
all this happened, and still pleasant, in
the cold country, to take the middle
of the day for going out. So Kitty
and Luly had their little blue poplin
"coat-dresses" buttoned on, and the
soft white woollen hoods tied under
their rosy faces, and Walter was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
decked out in <i>his</i> new blue coat;
which pleased him so much that he
distinguished himself immediately afterward
by walking all alone away
from the door to the window, quite
across the room, and there sitting
down suddenly on the floor, much to
his astonishment. At last they were
all ready and started off, Kitty and
Luly hand in hand, and Walter in his
little carriage.</p>

<p>The road they liked best led along
the top of a high bank, and was called
"Buena Vista" terrace. There were
very pretty houses built along here,
shaded by tall trees; and if the children
peeped cautiously over the iron
fence that guarded the edge of the
bank, they could sometimes see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
steam cars rushing along the shore
below. They were very fond of
watching the hurrying train go by,
though it frightened them a little,
particularly when the engine gave a
shrill scream before stopping at the
station about a quarter of a mile further
on. Kitty and Luly couldn't help
squealing too when that happened,
and then laughing very much, and
scampering on, playing they were
steam engines.</p>

<p>Just as they were passing by the
prettiest house on the terrace, out came
a young lady that Kitty and Luly
knew and loved dearly, with a "tremendous
dog" stalking slowly after
her.</p>

<p>"Why, Kitty!" she cried, "is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that you? Nurse, do bring the children
in. I want to see them so much!"</p>

<p>So Mary went to open the gate;
but before she could do so, up marched
Buffo, the "tremendous dog," and
lifted the latch with his nose! Oh,
how Kitty and Luly did laugh and
clap their hands! but their enjoyment
and surprise were at full height when
the kind young lady, whom they called
Miss Ella, lifted Luly, and Mary held
Wawa, on Buffo's shaggy back, and
the good fellow carried them both
safely to the house. Wawa crowed
and laughed, and drummed with his
heels against the side of his charger;
but the brave dog never tried to shake
him off, and just walked gravely along,
looking as trustworthy as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Then, when the little children got off,
Kitty mounted somewhat fearfully on
Buffo's broad back, and rode all around
the grass plot, laughing with delight.</p>

<p>After that, Miss Ella made them sit
down in a great rocking chair on the
porch, wide enough for all three to
get in at once, and asked them what
they had been doing that morning;
and then Kitty told about her being
Little Mother, and Luly said, so funny,
"Miniter tome see Luly and Kitty,
and tell funny 'tory 'bout Dilly, and
Dolly, and Popply-polly; and 'en&mdash;and
'en I talled Dody Popply-polly,
and s'e wan away!"</p>

<p>That amused Miss Ella very much,
and pretty soon she opened her work-box,
took out a paper of lemon drops,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and gave Luly, and Kitty, and Wawa
each a handful. Luly was a generous
little puss, and wanted every one to
share her "goodies;" so she even
offered a lemon drop to Buffo, when,
what do you think the great black
fellow did? He just put his great fore
paws on Luly's lap, opened his wide
red mouth, and eat up every one of the
drops at a mouthful!</p>

<p>Poor Luly opened <i>her</i> mouth in
rueful astonishment, and looked very
much as if she was going to burst out
crying; but Miss Ella consoled her by
giving her some more drops, and Wawa
thrust one of his into her mouth,
saying, "Dog eat Luly's d'ops; Wawa
torry."</p>

<p>So they talked away till it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
time to go; and then Miss Ella kissed
her little visitors; and Buffo wanted
to kiss them too, with his warm red
tongue; but Luly took good care to
be out of the way this time. I expect
the little thing thought he would eat
her up like a lemon drop; so Kitty
let him lick her hand instead; and
then Buffo let Miss Ella put Luly and
Wawa on his back again, and rode
them down to the gate, where they
bid good-by to their kind friend.</p>

<p>Tea was ready for them when they
came back, and "when fell the dew"
Luly and Kitty went "cheerfully up
stairs" to bed. And now a sweet, serious
expression came over Little
Mother's face, and her great brown
eyes were filled with loving reverence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
as Luly, in her little white night
gown, bent her golden curls on the
lap of her sister, and lisped out "Now
I <i>yay</i> me down to s'eep"&mdash;that
dear, precious little verse that I think
all the children in the world must say;
and prayed "Dear Jesus" to "b'ess
papa and mamma, and dear sister, and
'ittle bedder, and mate Luly dood 'ittle
child;" and as Little Mother's lips
were murmuring those words after
her, the door opened, and there stood
her own dear mamma and papa, just
home from the city; and oh! I can't
tell you half how much they loved
their darling ones when they saw that
sweet little scene.</p>

<p>And then there was a merry frolic
with papa, who rode Luly and Wawa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
on both shoulders as well as Buffo did;
and a happy time with dear mamma,
who brought them three great oranges
from grandma', and ever so many
kisses for her share; and a holy,
blessed time when that dear mamma
knelt by her precious Kitty's bedside,
and prayed God to bless and keep</p>

<h2>DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the sweet little ten-year old
maidens that ever laughed and danced
through their happy lives, I don't suppose
one had such a wonderful doll's
house, or such a fine family of dolls,
as Lina. Let me describe the family
and their residence.</p>

<p>In one of the upper rooms of Lina's
house you would see, if you happened
to walk in, another whole house built.
It is two stories high: its front is red
brick; and a flight of brown stone
steps, made of sand-paper glued over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
wood, leads up to the entrance. It
has real sashes in the windows, which
open French fashion; a silver door-plate,
with the name of "Montague"
upon it; and a little mat, about as
large as a half dollar, on the upper
step! If we could make ourselves as
small as dolls, we might walk in, and
find out that the hall has a dark wood
floor, some cunning little pictures
hanging on the wall, a noble black
walnut staircase, and is lighted with a
real little hall lamp.</p>

<p>The parlor, on one side of this hall,
has a velvet carpet on the floor, satin
chairs and sofas, a centre table covered
with tiny books, an &eacute;tagere full
of ornaments, and a wicker-work flower
stand filled with flowers. Real little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
mantel and pier glasses are over the
fire place, and between the front windows,
which are hung with elegant
lace curtains; and there is, besides, a
piano-forte, a gold chandelier stuck
full of china wax-candles, and a little
clock that can wind up&mdash;though as to
its going, that has to be imagined, for
it obstinately represents the time as a
quarter to twelve, morning, noon, and
night!</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the hall is
the dining-room. It is furnished with
a fine side-board, holding a silver tea-set
and some tiny glass goblets and
decanters; a round table, which is
abominably disorderly, it must be confessed,
being spread with a table cloth
all awry, and covered with a grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dinner of wooden chickens and vegetables
of various sorts; a mould of
yellow-glass jelly, and a pair of fancy
fruit dishes, made of cream candy.
The dining-room chairs, with real
leather seats, are scattered about, and
there is even the daily newspaper
thrown down on the floor, where the
master of the house may have left
it! Up stairs there are three bedrooms,
furnished in the same fashionable
style; and, in short, such an elegant
doll's house is not to be found
anywhere but in a French toy shop.
This one was brought from Paris by
Lina's elder brother, and set up in this
very room last Christmas as a surprise
for his dear little sister. But it is time
I should describe the family who lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in this elegant mansion. So, little
reader, if you will only take fast hold
of the end of the author's pen, shut
up your eyes tight, and then open
them very quick on this page, heigh!
presto! you and she will be turned
into little personages just the size of
dolls, able to walk up the brown stone
steps, enter the house, and take a peep
at the Montague family.</p>

<p>On a lounge by the parlor fire
sits an elegant lady, who is rather
skimpy about the wig, and therefore
holds the honorable post of mamma to
the family; as this circumstance, combined
with her looking excessively
inky about the nose, gives her a somewhat
aged and anxious appearance.
She wears a blue silk dress with five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
flounces, a lace cap, and a watch and
chain; and her name is Mrs. Charles
Augustus Montague. Her husband,
<i>Mr.</i> Charles Augustus, is a china doll
with a crop of rather scrubby flaxen
hair, which can be combed and
brushed as much as Lina chooses.
Although he is so rich, he has only
one suit of clothes, and must even go
to parties in a pair of checked gingham
trowsers, a red vest, and a blue
coat with brass buttons! He is supposed
to be down town at present,
which circumstance is represented by
his being unceremoniously thrust into
a corner upside down.</p>

<p>Several smaller wax and china
boys and girls represent the family of
the ill-used Mr. Montague; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
belle of the whole doll-community is
his eldest daughter, Miss Isabella Belmont
Montague. She is a waxen
young lady of the most splendid description;
her hair is arranged like the
empress', whom, indeed, she greatly
resembles; her feet and hands are of
wax, and she has more dresses than I
can possibly count. I am afraid you
will scarcely believe me, but she actually
has a real little ermine muff and
tippet, a pair of india-rubbers, an umbrella,
a camels' hair shawl, and <i>real
corsets!</i> and was won, with all her
wardrobe, at one of the raffles in the
great Union Bazaar. You went there,
didn't you&mdash;you cunning little kitten?
and saw all the dolls? I hope you got
one too, so I do, certainly!</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the Montague family, there
is a numerous colony of other dolls;
but they, poor things, live in any corner
where Lina chooses to put them;
and all day Sunday are shut up in a
dark closet, with nothing to do but
count their fingers and toes, if they
can contrive to see them; though they
have nearly as fine a wardrobe&mdash;for
Lina's great amusement, next to playing
with the whole colony, is to make
new dresses for them.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon, Lina was
playing with her dolls in the baby
house, with two of her little neighbors,
Minnie and Maggie Elliott, to keep
her company. It was a dark, rainy
sort of day; but what difference did
that make to the children? <i>They</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
never wanted to make a parcel of
stupid morning calls, or go out shopping
and spend all their money on silly
finery; no&mdash;they were full of their
play in the house, and didn't care a
doll's shoe-string how hard it rained.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Lina at last;
"seems to me this play is getting very
stupid! I wish we knew something
else to play at but everlasting
'house!'"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what would be great
fun!" said little Minnie, looking wise.
"You know, Lina, we spent a week
once in the country with 'Alice Nightcaps;'
and her sister, 'Aunt Fanny's'
daughter, showed us such a nice,
funny play! Instead of our being
mothers, and aunts, and fathers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the dolls our children, the dolls were
all the people themselves, and we
moved them about and spoke for
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was such a nice plan!"
said Maggie; "you can't think, Lina.
Suppose we divide these dolls into
families, and play that Miss Isabella
Belmont Montague was going to be
married, and all about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! yes! that will be splendid!"
cried Lina. "Whom will you
manage, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather have Miss Isabella,"
said Maggie.</p>

<p>"And I want Mr. Morris," said
Minnie. "He shall be the lover."</p>

<p>"Very well, then I'll make the father
and mother talk," said Lina, generously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
taking the less splendid dolls,
without a word of mean complaint,
such as "There, you hateful thing, you
always want the best;" or, "I <i>do</i> wish
I could do as I like with <i>my own</i>
dolls!" forgetting that company must
be allowed to take the best always.
The other dolls were equally divided
between the children, and then Lina
exclaimed, with a delighted little skip
in the air, "Now, we are all ready to
begin! Come, girls, what time shall
it be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, have them at breakfast!"
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ' himed'">chimed</ins> both the little visitors; and
so, in defiance of the parlor clock, the
time of day was supposed to be eight
in the morning. The children, with
many little chuckling pauses, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
they considered what to do next,
twitched the unlucky table cloth
straight, put the tea-set on the table,
and gave the family a wooden beefsteak
for breakfast, and a large plateful
of wooden buttered toast, which
came from a box full of such indigestible
dainties. Then they fished Mr.
Charles Augustus Montague out of
the corner, and set him upright in a
chair at the head of the table, with
his newspaper fastened in his hands,
by having a couple of large pins stuck
through it and them. The points of
the pins showed on the other side,
and looked as if he had a few extra
finger nails growing on the backs of
his hands. Quite a curiosity he'd
have been for Barnum's Museum,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
wouldn't he? you precious little old
toad.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montague was seated behind
the tea-tray, and Miss Isabella was
reclining on a sofa up stairs, as if she
was too lazy to come down when
the rest of the family did. As the
front door was only large enough for
the dolls, the whole back of the house
came away. Lina and her visitors
delightedly sat down cross-legged on
the floor behind it, and the play began,
the children talking for the dolls.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Montague.</span> (Lina speaks for
her in a fine voice.) I wish you would
lay down your paper a moment,
Charles; I want to speak to you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> Well, my dear, I am listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> No, you are not; put
down the paper! [As this couldn't
very well be done by the gentleman
himself, Maggie twitched it
away for him, and threw it under the
table.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Now, Charles, I must
say I think it is high time Isabella
was married. She is most six
months old, I declare! and it strikes
me we had better see if we can find
her a husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> What you say is very
sensible, my dear; so I will call to-day
on my friend Mr. Morris, and
invite him to dinner. Perhaps they
will fall in love with each other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Oh! but is he handsome,
Mr. Montague?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> Handsome! I should
rather think so! Why, he is nearly
two feet high, with curly black hair;
a nose that can be seen at the side&mdash;which
is more than yours can be,
Mrs. Montague&mdash;and eyes which open
and shut of themselves when he lies
down or sits up. Then he is a Seventh
Regimenter, too, and always wears
his uniform; which makes him look
very genteel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Oh, I am sure he must
be lovely! Do bring him to dinner
this very day.</p>

<p>Here Maggie made the dining-room
door open, and in walked Miss
Isabella. She wore a pink merino<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
morning dress, open in front, to show
her embroidered petticoat, a pair of
bronze slippers with pink bows, and a
net with steel beads in it. Maggie
set her down hard in one of the
chairs, and pushed her up to the table;
while Minnie, who moved the nigger
boy doll, who waited on table, picked
him up by his woolly top-knot, from
the floor, where he had tumbled, and
made him hand the young lady a cup
of tea. Then Maggie began:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Isabella.</span> Dear me, mamma!
this tea's as cold as a stone! I wish
you would have breakfast a little
later; as I'm so tired when I come
home from a party, that I can't think
of getting up at seven o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> But you must get up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
my love. Besides, we want plenty of
time to-day, so's we can be ready; for
we are going to have company to
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Who is coming, mamma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Mr. Morris, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Oh, I am so glad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Yes, you're going to be
married to-morrow, my dear; we will
invite all our relations and friends,
and you must have a white satin
wedding dress; you certainly must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> How nice! S'pose we
go out and buy it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> We can't go to-day;
it's our <i>eceptin</i> (reception) day, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> Well, I 'spect I must go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
down town. Good-by, my dears. I
shall certainly ask Mr. Morris to dinner.
He's a very nice young man for
a small dinner party.</p>

<p>So the children made Mr. Montague
kiss his wife and daughter;
which they did by bumping his china
nose against their cheeks, until it
nearly made a dent in the wax; and
then pranced him down the front steps,
and put him in his corner again.</p>

<p>Then Minnie's doll came in. She
took up Mr. Morris, a composition
doll, in a Seventh Regiment uniform,
who had been bought at a fair, and
began moving him across the floor
until he was opposite the door. Then
she commenced talking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Why, I declare! here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
is Mr. Montague's house. I think I
will go in and make a call.</p>

<p>And he ran up the steps, and pretended
to ring the bell; but as it was
only a handle, Lina rang the dinner
bell instead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> It's very funny they
don't answer the bell! (Ting-a-ling-ling.)
Come! make haste, I want to
get in.</p>

<p>Here Minnie took up Toby, the
black boy, carried him to the front
door, and kindly opened it for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toby.</span> Laws, massa! is dat you?
I was jus' tastin' de jolly, to be sure
it was good for dinner! so I couldn't
come no sooner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Is Miss Isabella Belmont
Montague at home?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toby.</span> Yes, massa, de ladies is to
hum; walk in de parlor.</p>

<p>So Mr. Morris came in (with Minnie's
hand behind him), and sat down
on the sofa. It was rather small for
him, and he covered it up so much
that there wasn't a bit of room for
Miss Isabella, when she came down.
Maggie had dressed her meanwhile in
her green silk skirt, which had real
little three-cornered pockets, with
an embroidered pocket handkerchief
sticking out of one, and her white
tucked waist.</p>

<p>Up jumped Mr. Morris, and made
her such an elegant bow, that his cap,
which he was obliged to keep on all
the time, in consequence of the strap
being glued fast under his chin, fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
all to one side; and looked as if the
top of his head had accidentally come
off and been stuck on crooked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Good morning, Miss
Isabella; how do you do?</p>

<p><i>Isabella</i>. Very well, thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Morris?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Oh, Miss Isabella, I
should be quite well if I hadn't <i>sitch</i>
a pain in my heart!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> A pain in your heart!
What makes you have that, Mr.
Morris?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> YOU!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Oh, Miss Isabella,
you can't think how I adore you! I
love you so much that it makes my
eyes shut up when I don't want them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to; and my heart beats so that it
shakes my cap all to one side!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Dear me, Mr. Morris,
you are quite <i>afflitted!</i> but never
mind&mdash;papa is going to have you to
dinner to-day; you'd better go right
down town, so he can ask you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> But I can't eat any
dinner, Miss Isabella, without you will
marry me!</p>

<p>Here Minnie tried to make Mr.
Morris pop down on his knees; but
as he wasn't a jointed doll, he lost his
balance, and tumbled flat on his face
instead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Isabella.</span> Here, what are you
doing? get up, do, and stop your noise!
[For Minnie couldn't help a long-sounding
o&mdash;h! when her doll flopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
down. So Maggie made the young
lady catch hold of Mr. Morris's shoulder
straps and help twitch him on the
sofa again, to go on with his proposal.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Will you marry me,
Miss Isabella? I'm such a nice young
man&mdash;you don't know&mdash;and we'll live
in a real pretty house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Isabella.</span> No, I can't marry
you till after you have come to dinner;
mamma said so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Well, then, I must
wait; but only say that you will have
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Oh, yes!</p>

<p>At this point the children laid down
the dolls and broke into such a merry
trill of laughter, that it would have
done anybody's heart good to hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
them. It seemed so funny to have the
dolls making love in this fashion, they
couldn't help it. As soon as they were
sober again, the play went on thus:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Well, Miss Isabella, I
b'lieve I must go now; I've got an old
sister at home, who will scold me if I
don't come back. Can't you 'vite her
too? She has a pretty bad time, poor
thing! 'cause she is so oldy that she
is kept on a shelf till she's all dusty.
Her wig is dreadful fuzzy, and some
of it comes out and stands up at the
top. But I'll dust her well and stick
a pin in her wig to keep it on, and
make her look real nice, if you'll only
ask her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Well, I guess she can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
come; but she must have a new dress
for the wedding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Yes, she shall, certainly.
Good-by, Miss Isabella. I'm
going down town pretty soon, so your
father can ask me to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Isabella.</span> Oh yes, do! I
want you to come <i>velly</i> much.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Now, Maggie, we must stop the
play a little while," said Lina, "and
fix the dinner for them."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," cried Maggie; "let's
see, what shall be for dinner?"</p>

<p>"Oh, chicken, that's the nicest!"
said Minnie.</p>

<p>"No, they had chicken yesterday,"
said Lina; "let them have roast
beef."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," went on Maggie, who
was looking over the dishes in the box
of "eatables," as Lina called them.
"Roast beef, mashed potatoes, and
macaroni."</p>

<p>"Oh, not macaroni," cried Minnie;
"the cheese will bite their tongues."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Mr. Morris likes macaroni,"
said her sister.</p>

<p>"Well, macaroni, then; and plum-pudding
for dessert&mdash;and apples."</p>

<p>"Ah, make them have jelly," said
Lina; "that's the prettiest thing in
the box."</p>

<p>So the dinner was hunted out, and
the three children set the table in fine
style; while Toby, the black boy, whose
business it certainly was to have done
it, sat coolly in Mr. Montague's armchair,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
with his master's newspaper in
his lap, and goggled at the table without
moving an inch. Then Lina
dressed Mrs. Montague, and Maggie
and Minnie together dressed Miss Isabella;
and nobody dressed poor Mr.
Morris, or Mr. Charles Augustus Montague;
because they unluckily had
but one suit a piece, sewed fast on to
them at that.</p>

<p>This time Miss Isabella wore a pink
silk frock, with a deep puffing round
the bottom, finished at each edge with
black velvet. Then she had a long
pink sash, edged with two rows of
narrow black velvet; a pointed belt
encircled her waist, and the body of
her dress was a mass of puffs, with
narrow black velvet between. On her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
head was a pink wreath, with long ribbon
ends hanging down her back; and
tied fast to her wrist was a pink
feather fan with gold sticks. In fact,
Miss Isabella looked rather as if she
were going to a party than coming
down to dinner; but the children
thought the pink silk so charming,
that she must wear it, whether or no.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montague wore a purple silk,
a black lace shawl, and a head-dress
of pink rosebuds and black lace.</p>

<p>When the ladies were fairly seated
in the parlor, Lina rang the bell, and
Minnie and Maggie made Mr. Morris
come in, leading his sister by the
hand. She was a dismal object to behold,
sure enough! and if she could
have blushed for herself, I think she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
certainly would. She wore a green
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'barege'">bar&egrave;ge</ins> dress, trimmed with flaming
red ribbons; some of the gathers were
out at the waist, and her petticoat
showed at the bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris, or Minnie&mdash;I don't
know which&mdash;had stuck the ends of
her wig down for her once, but they
had come up again, and looked as if
her hair had taken to growing with
the roots uppermost. The end of her
nose was blacker than Mrs. Montague's,
and her eyes, which moved with
a wire like other wax dolls, had got
out of order somehow, and remained
stationary, with nothing but the whites
showing; and, altogether, poor Miss
Morris looked like a two-legged rag-bag
come home from the wars, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
both eyes out, half a nose, and no hair
worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Lina made Mr. Montague come
home as soon as she was rid of the
dinner bell; and after they had all
shaken hands until their wax and
kid and china wrists must have ached,
the company rather unceremoniously
marched right into the dining-room.
I suppose Mr. Montague was tremendously
hungry, and gave his wife's
hand a good pinch when he shook it,
to make her hurry things up; but,
however that may be, they were
walked in to dinner in straight order.
Mr. Morris sat by Miss Isabella, with
his forlorn old sister on the other
hand, and as the opposite side of the
table looked rather bare, Minnie proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that some of the children should
come down to fill up.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;and let them be dreadfully
naughty and do all sorts of mischief,"
said Maggie. So Miss Angelina
Seraphina Montague, and Master Algernon
Pop-eyes Montague (so called
because he had glass eyes, which stuck
out in a lobster-ish fashion), were sent
for in a hurry and brought down by
their nurse, a beautiful doll dressed as a
French bonne, and Maggie. Algernon
wore the costume of a sailor boy, and
Angelina was no other than a nun in
a black robe! But never mind, they
did very well to fill up, and sat smirking
at the company very genteelly.</p>

<p>So, then, Lina made Mr. Montague
begin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mont.</span> Will you take some
roast beef, Miss Morris?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Algernon.</span> No, papa, help me
first!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> Algy Pop-eyes Montague!
be still! Here, Toby, hand Miss Morris
her plate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Algy.</span> Don't you do it, Toby!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Hush up, you naughty
boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> Mr. Morris, here's some
meat for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Take some macaroni,
Mr. Morris; it's real good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Thank you, ma'am; I
think I will.</p>

<p>So the company were helped;
though, as the meat and vegetables
were glued fast to the dishes they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
were on, I'm afraid they must have
had rather a slim dinner.</p>

<p>Then Maggie went on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Isabella.</span> Mr. Morris, I think
I am rather tired of that uniform of
yours; it makes you look too high in
the neck. When we are married, you
ought to have a dress coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angelina.</span> H-a! h-a-a-a! he hasn't
got any other coat! <i>I</i> wouldn't marry
an old goose with only one suit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> For shame, Miss! your
father hadn't but one when we were
married; but, bless me! what <i>is</i> Algernon
doing?</p>

<p>Sure enough, Master Algy <i>was</i>
doing something extraordinary, for
Maggie had made him overset the dish
of potatoes in the middle of the table,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and then jump up and sit on the back
of his chair, with both legs in the air!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> My pasence! <i>what</i> a
naughty boy! Toby, take this bad
boy right up stairs; I am socked!
(shocked.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Algy.</span> Oh, boo-hoo! boo-hoo!
please let me stay!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Well, then, behave yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Morris.</span> Mrs. Montague, I
think you had <i>better</i> send your children
away; they are too bad for anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angelina.</span> Oh! oh! I wouldn't be
your child for a dollar! ("That's just
what I say to my big sister!" put in
Maggie in her proper person.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Oh, they are dear little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
things; they only do it in fun, Miss
Morris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Well, I don't see it.
If they were my children, I should
lock them up in a dark closet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Morris.</span> So should I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angelina.</span> H-a! h-a-a-a! that's just
where you are kept yourself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Morris.</span> Oh, I <i>shall</i> faint!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Angelina! you sha'n't
have any pudding for being so bad.
There, I guess it's time for dessert,"&mdash;and
without condescending to ask if
the company were through dinner,
Mrs. Montague, with a wave of her
lily-white kid hand, ordered Toby to
clear away the dishes; and, the pudding
and jelly being put on the table,
Lina went on:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> Miss Morris, have some
plum-pudding?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toby.</span> No, take some ob de jolly,
missis; he so <i>jolly</i> good! <i>I</i> taste um!</p>

<p>Mr. M. Toby, I am <i>astonissed!</i> I
shall have to discharge you to-morrow.</p>

<p>"And have an Irishman come!"
cried Minnie; "and talk funny, like
our Patrick!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that will be real fun!" said
Lina. "There, they have had dinner
enough; let them go in the parlor
now."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the company had
their chairs pushed back for them
and were taken into the parlor, all but
the naughty children, who had to be
sent straight to bed, they were so bad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Mr. and Mrs. Montague took possession
of the arm chairs, as they were
the oldest; Miss Morris was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'acommodated'">accommodated</ins>
with an uncommonly hard ottoman
without any back, in the corner;
Mr. Morris plumped down on the sofa,
as that was the only seat large enough
for him, and the play went on (Minnie
speaking).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Miss Isabella, I wish
you would sing us a song.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Oh, really, I have <i>sitch</i>
a bad cold. I don't think I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Oh, please do, Miss
Isabella! Sing that pretty song about
the little milkmaid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Well, I'll see if I can.</p>

<p>So Maggie made the young lady
take a funny little scrap of music out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the stand (called a Canterbury),
and put it on the piano. The title of
the piece on the outside was, "Souvenirs
de l'Opera," which means in
English "Recollections of the Opera,"
but it did just as well for a song. Miss
Isabella was seated at the piano, and
Maggie moved her hands up and down
the keys, to look as if she were playing;
while in her own sweet bird-like
voice she sang for her this song:</p>

<div class='poem'>

</div>

<p>The dolls all clapped their hands
very hard when Miss Isabella finished
singing, as if they liked it "first rate."
Mr. Morris leaned back so far in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
seat, either from admiration or because
he was slipping off, that his eyes
suddenly shut up, and opened with a
queer little pop inside of him when
Minnie righted him. As to Miss Morris,
she glared at the company with
her old white eyeballs as if she was
looking down inside of herself to see
how the pudding had agreed with her.</p>

<p>Then Maggie went on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Isabella.</span> There! how do
you like <i>that?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Oh, thank you, Miss
Isabella; it's the sweetest song I ever
heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Montague.</span> Won't you sing
us a song, Mr. Morris?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> No, I believe I must go
now. I have all my things to pack up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
so we can start off travelling right
away. Come, sister, stick the roots
of your hair in, and open your distressed
looking eyes, and let us be off
home.</p>

<p>"I wonder if her eyes <i>will</i> open?"
said Maggie.</p>

<p>"Let's try!" said Lina. "Give
the wire a good, hard pull."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she caught hold of
the wire and gave a tremendous jerk,
when, dreadful to relate, <span class="smcap">pop</span>! out
came poor Miss Morris's eyes completely!
and tumbled down somewhere
inside of her! leaving two
great holes in her head of the most
fearful description!</p>

<p>The children stared at her in round-eyed
astonishment. Now she was certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
too hideous to come to the
wedding; and the little girls tried to
look as sorry as they could for her,
but it was no use; Miss Morris was
such a ridiculous object, that they all
three burst into fits of laughing. Lina,
who had hold of the poor thing, shook
so with glee, that the eyes rattled up
and down inside her head like a pack
of crackers going off, which made the
children laugh still more.</p>

<p>At last Minnie contrived to check
herself, and made the brother say,
rather unfeelingly:</p>

<p>Mr. Morris. There you go with
your eyes out! A pretty figure you've
made of yourself.</p>

<p>Miss Isabella. Oh! <i>oh!!</i> <span class="smcap">oh!!!</span>
OH!!!!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Goody, Isabella's got the
hysterics! Get some water, quick!
what shall I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Morris.</span> Oh, my eye! my eye!
it's <i>sich</i> a pain!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Montague.</span> Toby, bring some
water this minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toby.</span> (<i>Minnie brings him in with
a pitcher.</i>) Here, massa, here de water.
My! see de ole woman wid her
eye out! ha! ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Toby, put down that water,
and go 'way.</p>

<p>Minnie accordingly made believe
that Toby was pouring water right on
the floor; then she turned the pitcher
upside down in his hand, and spoke
for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toby.</span> Dere de water, missis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Oh! it's all over the
carpet! How dare you, Toby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toby.</span> Why, missis, you <i>told</i> me to
put down de <i>water!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Oh, I shall go distracted!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morris.</span> Come, sister, I 'spect
you'd better go home and send for
Doctor Bumpstead! Maybe he can
fish up your eyes again, and stick them
in right side out. A&mdash;h! good-by,
Miss Isabella, good-by, Mrs. Montague!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All the dolls in chorus.</span> Good-by,
a&mdash;h!</p>

<p>"Oh! did ever anybody have such
a funny play before!" cried Lina,
fairly dropping Miss Morris, and clapping
her hands with delight. "I mean
always to play in this way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is so nice!" said Minnie.
"But, come, Lina, how shall we dress
Miss Isabella to get married?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she has a wedding-dress all
ready," replied Lina; "white silk
with lace over."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" cried both the sisters.</p>

<p>"Now, if Mr. Morris could only
have a plain suit, he would look so
much more like a bridegroom."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps sister will make
him one," said Lina; "but what shall
we do with poor Miss Morris?"</p>

<p>The recollection of Miss Morris's
mishap set them off again laughing;
and finally they decided that she
might come to the wedding, but must
keep her handkerchief to her eyes all
the time, as if she were quite overcome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
by having her brother married;
as well she might be, for how would
her two holes instead of eyes compare
with Miss Isabella Belmont Montague's
charms?</p>

<p>This point settled, Lina and her little
visitors were just beginning to review
the other dolls, to see who would
look best at the wedding, when a
knock came at the door, and in
walked Mary, Lina's nurse, to say
that Minnie and Maggie were sent
for!</p>

<p>"Oh, what a pity!" cried Lina.
"I wish you could stay all day, and
all night, and all the rest of the time.
It's too bad!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that the afternoons were forty-'leven
times as long!" said Maggie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
"Well, we must go, I suppose. Good-by,
Lina; we'll come Monday afternoon,
if mamma will let us; and finish
the play."</p>

<p>So the children kissed each other,
and Minnie and Maggie were bundled
up in their warm coats and hoods, and
went home. As soon as they were
gone, Lina ran to her sister Alice with
Mr. Morris, and begged her to make
him a suit of black to get married in,
as Miss Isabella had expressed her
preference for that style of dress.
Alice kindly promised she would, and
that very evening she hunted up some
black cloth that was left from a cloak
of her mother's, and in a few hours
Mr. Morris was rigged out in the last
style of fashion. Here is his carte de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
visite, taken in his wedding clothes.
You see, the photograph man left his
own hat on the table by mistake;
doesn't it look funny?</p>

<span class="caption">Portrait of Mr. Morris.</span>
</div>

<p>It was past Lina's bedtime before
Mr. Morris was completely dressed;
but she was allowed to sit up "just
this once," and when he was finished,
she kissed Alice a great many times,
carried him off in triumph, and shut
him up tight in a box, for fear his
clothes should get tumbled.</p>

<p>Monday afternoon, Minnie and
Maggie came again, bringing with
them a dear little wax doll of Minnie's,
and a great paper of sugar-plums, to
"play party" with. When Mr. Morris
had been sufficiently admired in his
new clothes, the children collected the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
other dolls, and put the Montague
family in their house again. Mr.
Montague was left all alone in the
parlor to receive the company, and
the ladies were up stairs in the front
bed room. Miss Isabella's wedding
dress was spread out on the elegant
French bed, all ready for her to
wear; and as it is a well-known fact
that a fashionable lady cannot possibly
get dressed in less than three
hours, the time was put at nine
o'clock, as the wedding would take
place at twelve.</p>

<p>Lina then began the play:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Montague.</span> Come, my dear,
it is time for you to dress; you've
only got three hours to get all ready
in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Isabella.</span> Yes, mamma, I am
putting on my shoes now. (That is,
Maggie was putting them on.) Oh,
dear! they are a great deal too tight!
they hurt me <i>dreadfully</i>. Please let
me take them off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> No, they are not; they are
a beautiful fit; don't be silly, Isabella.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> I think you are real
mean! There, they are on; now I
must put on my dress.</p>

<p>Here Maggie made her stand up,
and Lina put on her dress and fastened
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Oh, my! what a beautiful
dress! Can't I keep it on all the
time, mamma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Why, no; of course not!
This is your wedding dress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Well, then, I mean to
get married over again next year, so
I can wear it some more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Now I must put on your
veil, my dear, and then you will be all
ready.</p>

<p>Here Maggie clapped her hands
to express Miss Isabella's joy, while
Lina put on the veil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Oh, how pretty I look!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Don't be vain, Isabella.
There, you are dressed; sit down now,
while I get ready.</p>

<p>So Miss Isabella sat down with
her new frock sticking out all around
her, like a perfect balloon, a most magnificent
creature to behold! Her dress
was made of white silk, trimmed all
round the bottom with deep blonde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
lace, which was finished at the top
with narrow silver cord. It was
looped up on one side with a bouquet
of white flowers, with silver leaves,
and her waist was covered with a
blonde lace bertha, and had a bouquet
of the same flowers on the front, called
a <i>corsage</i>. She wore a lace veil and a
wreath of orange blossoms, and in her
hand, tied fast there, was another large
bouquet, and a lace-bordered pocket
handkerchief. As to Mrs. Montague,
she was hardly less splendidly attired,
in a mauve silk with eleven flounces, a
lace collar and sleeves, and a superb
diamond breastpin&mdash;made of glass.</p>

<p>Well, dear me, I don't know how I
can find room enough to describe all
the splendid ladies that came to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
wedding. They were none of them
quite as elegant as Miss Isabella Belmont
Montague, but they all had on
their Sunday-go-to-meeting, Fourth-of-July,
Christmas-and-New-Year's
best clothes, and looked as fine as fiddles.
Poor Miss Morris came, with her
handkerchief up to her eyes, and
stayed so all the time, crying as if her
heart would break, I presume. She was
so dismal, in her old green bar&egrave;ge, that
Minnie kindly dressed her in Mrs.
Montague's purple silk, which fitted
her quite well; so she didn't look so
<i>very</i> bad, after all. Aren't you glad?
I am.</p>

<p>Pretty soon in came the minister,
who was no other than Angelina! as
her black nun's robe was the most like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a gown that could be found; and
when she was set up with her back
against the centre table, the parlor
door opened, and in marched the bride
and bridegroom. Minnie and Maggie
held them in their proper places, and
the minister married them in rhyme;
which, it strikes me, was a new style.
This was what he said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Now you're married, you must obey;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You must be true to all you say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And live together all your life;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And I pronounce you man and wife!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>When the marriage ceremony was
over, the children set Mr. and Mrs.
Morris down side by side on the sofa,
and leaving them to entertain the
company, and talk for themselves if
they could, got the supper ready. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was such a grand supper that they
were obliged to have a table from up
stairs besides the dining table. Everything
in the box of eatables was
brought out, even the roast beef and
buttered toast, two dishes not ordinarily
seen at suppers. The sugar-plums
were disposed around wherever room
could be found, and when everything
was ready, Minnie took Toby to the
parlor door and made him say:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Toby.</span></span><br />
Ladies and gentlemens, please to come to supper,<br />
Plum cake, and cream cake, and white bread and butter.<br />
</div>

<p>Up jumped Mr. Morris in such a
violent hurry that he nearly tumbled
over, and offered his arm to his bride;
which Minnie made him do by bending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
it round, and pinning his kid hand
fast to his waistcoat. Maggie and
Lina made the rest of the company
walk after them in procession, as fast
as they could lift them up; and they
all pranced and paraded round by the
back of the house into the dining
room. Only poor Miss Morris was left
out, and she had tumbled off her chair,
and was lying behind the piano, on the
top of her head, with one leg sticking
straight up in the air like an awning
post, and the other foot apparently
boxing her ears, as it was turned back
in a most extraordinary manner, till it
touched her head.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there were fine times
going on in the dining room. Mr.
Montague took the foot of the table,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and the bride and groom the head.
As soon as they were all seated, Mr.
Montague said:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Montague.</span> Ladies and gentlemen,
don't you think we'd better
drink the bride's health? Here, Toby,
give the company some wine glasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Dear me, ladies, what a
pity! there's only six goblets; so the
rest will have to drink out of teacups!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All the Dolls</span> (or all the three
little girls, whichever you please).
Oh, never mind; that doesn't make
any <i>difference</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mont.</span> The bride, ladies and
gentlemen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All the Dolls.</span> Mrs. Morris! hurray!
hurree! hurror!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Now, Isabella, it's time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
for you to change your dress, my
dear. You are going travelling, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabella.</span> Oh, what a pity! I
don't want to take it off a bit!</p>

<p>But, of course, she had to. It
wouldn't have done to go travelling in
a white silk dress, would it, you dear
little poppet?</p>

<p>So Maggie took Miss Isabella (for
they called her either that or Mrs. Morris
by turns, indifferently), away from table,
and dressed her in her gray travelling
dress, which was trimmed with black
velvet and small steel buttons. Then
she put on her second best bonnet,
with a blue veil, and her India-rubbers,
in case it should be damp, and
locked up the wedding dress in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
trunk, which was about as large as a
candle box, had a real little lock and
key, and her initials painted on the
side. When she was all ready, down
she came again, to take leave of her
relations and friends, who had eaten
up all the wooden refreshments by this
time (though, strange to say, the
dishes seemed as full as ever), while
Minnie, Maggie, and Lina eat up the
sugar plums; and poor Miss Morris
sucked her thumbs, I suppose, for not
a speck of anything else did she get.</p>

<p>There was a great time bidding
good-by, and so many hard noses were
bumped against the bride's cheek
this time, that they made a dent,
which looked quite like a dimple, and
improved her appearance very much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
indeed. As to Mr. Morris, nobody
took the slightest notice of him, as is
usually the case with the bridegroom,
but he didn't seem to mind it in the
least; for he went on smirking at the
company as blandly as ever. Perhaps
he didn't want people's noses making
holes in <i>his</i> face; you wouldn't want
them made in <i>yours</i>, would you? you
dear little Pinkey Winkey! Bless
your heart! there's dimples enough in
that cunning face already.</p>

<p>But now the carriage was brought
round to the door, for Mr. and Mrs.
Morris to go on their travels. It was
made of&mdash;ahem!&mdash;tin, and was drawn
by two dashing tin horses, with tails
like comets, and manes like waterfalls,
and such a great number of bright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
red spots painted all over them, that
they looked as if they had broken out
with a kind of scarlet measles.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom were
put in their places, the big trunk was
hoisted up in front, and away they
went! and travelled all the way down
the entry to the head of the stairs,
and through sister Alice's room to the
fireplace! My! what a long journey!
'most a hundred miles, I should think!
that is, it would seem so to dolls.</p>

<p>Thus ended the grand play of Miss
Isabella Belmont Montague's wedding,
which had taken two whole afternoons
to finish, and which the children
thought the most <i>interestingest</i> play
that ever was. If you want to know
what became of her after that, I advise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
you to go right to Lina's house
and ask how Mr. and Mrs. Morris come
on with their housekeeping! That's
all there is of this story&mdash;BOO!!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FAIRY WISH.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there lived a little
old man, with his little old wife, in
a little old house that ran on wheels.
Did you ever? Well, I never did.</p>

<p>The reason why the little old house
ran on wheels was, that the little old
man used to keep a monkey show in
it, and drove it about for a caravan;
with an old white horse, that had a
blind eye, to draw it; but now the
monkeys were all dead and buried, and
the little old man and woman lived all
alone-ty-donty. It had bright green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
blinds, bright red sides, a bright blue
door, and bright yellow steps. On the
bright blue door there was a bright
brass knocker, which was polished up
at such a rate that you could see your
face in it, looking as l-o-n-g as anything;
and underneath that was a
bright brass door plate, with the old
showman's name, "Timmy Timmens,"
on it, which was also polished up until
you could see your face in it, looking
as b-r-o-a-d as anything. Did you
<i>ever?</i> Well, I <i>never</i> did!</p>

<p>Inside there was a rag carpet of all
the colors of the rainbow; a little old
four-post bedstead, with a patchwork
counterpane; two high-backed rocking
chairs, with patchwork covers over
the backs; a table with an oil cloth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
cover, that had a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'litle'">little</ins> old tea tray on
it, set up against the wall; two bright
brass candlesticks, and a china tea
set; and in one corner was a glass
cupboard, which contained the other
plates and dishes. Hung against the
wall over the mantlepiece was a sampler
worked by Mrs. Timmy Timmens
when she was a girl, which represented
Noah's ark, with all the animals, of
exactly the same size, done in cross
stitch, in such bright grass-green
worsted that it quite set your teeth
on edge to look at it. Besides these,
there was a little round stove, with a
long stove pipe, that came out on top
of the caravan, and ended with a
flourishing weathercock, representing
a fat old woman in a high gale, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
her umbrella turned inside out; which
moved when the smoke came puffing
up harder than usual, and had no connection
whatever with any wind that
blew.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Timmy Timmens and his
wife, being mighty simple old people,
were fond of reading fairy stories, and
believed entirely in every word of
them. They hadn't the smallest doubt
that sprites and fairies were as common
as peas this very minute, and
would have thought it quite a matter
of course if a wonderful gift had suddenly
tumbled down the very stove
pipe, or a beautiful lady come bursting
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'throught'">through</ins> the wall, and offered to carry
them off to fairy land in a mother-of-pearl
chariot, drawn by milk-white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
doves. If a cat looked hard at her
and mewed piteously, the little old
woman would sigh, "Well, this <i>is</i> fairy
work, I'll bet a crooked sixpence! She
looks like an enchanted princess, poor
thing! don't she, Timmy, dear?" If
a donkey brayed louder than usual,
and seemed more obstinate than ever
before, the little old man would exclaim,
"There, I told you so! an unfortunate
young man, of surpassing
beauty, enchanted in this dreadful
shape by a wicked fairy! That's plain
to be seen! No wonder he utters such
cries of distress!" and then they both
groaned together, and waggled their
heads, and blew their noses so exactly
in time with two yellow silk pocket
handkerchiefs, that people thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
two fishmen must be blowing their
horns at once. Did <i>you</i> ever? Well,
<i>I</i> never did!</p>

<span class="caption">THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN LOOKING FOR FAIRIES.</span>
</div>

<p>One fine morning the little old man
and woman went out to take a walk
on the common; for the house stood
right beside the road, in an empty
field of scrubby grass, with no fence
round it. Just behind the house, to
be sure, was a paling, which enclosed
a garden about as big as a good-sized
dining table, where the little old man
and woman grew one or two cabbages,
two or three tomatuses, three or four
potatuses, and four or five radishes,
for their own eating; but all the rest
was just open common. The old
woman had a large basket in her hand,
all ready to pop down over any fairies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
she might see lying asleep in a bluebell,
and the old man was leaning
heavily on his stick, as he was rather
feeble, and, besides, had the rheumatism
in his big toe.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Timmy," said the old
woman, "what a good thing it would
be, now, if we could only find a kind
fairy who would move our house for
us somewhere nearer the village. Now
that poor old Dobbin is dead&mdash;killed,
I've no doubt, by a wicked enchanter&mdash;we
can no longer get around from
place to place without stirring a step
from the house; and we are so far
away, that we can't walk over to take
tea with any of our neighbors. Do let
us keep a sharp lookout as we walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
along, and see if we can't find a fairy
ring or a fairy flower."</p>

<p>"With all my heart!" said Tim;
and so they tottered along, peering
very hard into all the bushes, and hurrying
to examine every little patch of
grass that looked greener and brighter
than the rest, in the hope that it was
a fairy ring. All at once, the little old
man stopped short, and pointed with
his stick at a beautiful spray of foxglove.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Mr. Timmens.</p>

<p>"Where?" cried Mrs. Timmens.</p>

<p>"Right before your eyes!" said
the little old man. "Don't you see
it? A fairy foxglove, as my name is
Timmy Timmens!"</p>

<p>"My goodness gracious, stars, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
what's-his-names!" cried the little old
woman; "so there is! as sure as my
name is Polly Timmens!"</p>

<p>So the little old man and woman
hurried up to the flower, and after
trying a great many times to stoop
down, making their old joints crack
like so many torpedoes, Mrs. Polly
succeeded in plucking it, and off they
went, pell-mell, hurry-scurry, to the
little old house that ran on wheels, to
consult their fairy story books, and
see what was the right thing to be
done in such a case! <i>Did</i> you ever?
Well, I never <i>did</i>.</p>

<p>Down sat the little old man in <i>his</i>
rocking chair with the patchwork
cover, and down sat the little old
woman in <i>her</i> rocking chair with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
patchwork cover; and after a long
consultation of the "Sorrows of Prince
Popinjay," and the "Wonderful History
of the Princess Lillie Bulero and
the Fairy Allinmieyeo," they discovered
that the proper way to do was
to hold the fairy foxglove in your
hand exactly as the clock struck
twelve, at noon, and say</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Rorum corum torum snoram,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Highcum tickleme cockolorum!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>seven times; then shut your eyes tight
and wish, stand on one leg and turn
round three times, and, presto! you
would find, when you opened your
eyes, that your wish was accomplished!</div>

<p>"Dear me!" cried Mrs. Polly Timmens
when her husband had finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
reading this wonderful charm; "how
lucky it is that we should be the ones
to find the fairy foxglove! just as we
were wishing, too, for something of
the sort. Let me see, it is half past
eleven now, I declare! Timmy, my
dear, I'll go into the garden and gather
two or three tomatuses and three or
four potatuses for dinner, for it would
be a shame to leave our fine vegetables
behind; and then, as the clock
strikes twelve, we'll try the fairy spell,
wish that our house was in the village,
and see what comes of it."</p>

<p>So the little old woman, taking a
small basket off a nail, and a sharp
knife in her hand, went into the garden
to gather the vegetables. Down
she plumped beside the bed, and began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to dig and cut at the potatuses to get
them up. Her back was turned to the
house, and the tall stalks and thick
leaves of the tomato bushes quite hid
it from her view when she sat on the
ground, for she was a teeny-tawny little
old woman. While she was thus
engaged, the little old man was sitting
inside with the book open in one hand,
for fear he should forget the charm,
and the fairy foxglove tight in the
other, waiting impatiently for her return.
The hands of the clock kept
getting nearer and nearer to twelve,
and at last there was only one moment
wanting to the time.</p>

<p>"Why, goodness gracious me!"
cried Mr. Timmy Timmens; "has Polly
forgot all about the fairy wish? I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
declare, I have a great mind to begin
alone." Just as he said these words,
the clock began to strike! and at the
same moment a tremendous hullabaloo
arose on the road. "There come the
fairies!" squeaked the little old man;
and without waiting another second,
he stood straight up in the middle
of the floor, and said, in a trembling
voice:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Rorum corum torum snorum,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Highcum tickleme cockolorum!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>seven times over; then, shutting up his
eyes as tight as possible, stood on one
leg, and cried, "Please, good fairy,
Polly and I wish our house was in the
middle of the village!"</div>

<p>Hardly had he said these words,
than a long red object, that looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
wonderfully like a cow's tail, suddenly
whisked in at the half open door; the
wind caught the door, and shut it to,
slam! bang! and with a jerk that
made the bright brass knocker give
a tremendous double knock on the
bright blue door, and sent the bright
tin saucepans scattering in every direction,
the house started suddenly
down on the road on a double-quick
trot! Did you <span class="smcap">ever</span>?! Well, I <span class="smcap">never</span>
did!!</p>

<p>It happened that a large drove of
cows and oxen were going down to
market that day, and being very hot,
and tired, and thirsty, they naturally
objected to being driven in that way
any longer, and commenced cutting a
variety of capers that were enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
frighten you out of your wits. At last
one irascible little bull, who had been
riding on the other ones' backs,
charging at all the innocent ducks,
geese, and pigs he could find on the
road, and finally had tossed one of the
men who were driving him right up in
the air, dashed on ahead, and, seeing
the little house with the bright red
sides, took the color as a personal insult
to himself. Down went his head
and up went his heels, and in another
minute he would have bounced right
into poor Mr. Timmy Timmens' dwelling,
when one of the drivers saw him,
and rushing up, gave him a good whack
with his whip. Master Bull turned
round to see what was to pay; in an
instant his tail was caught in the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as I told you, and, frightened half out
of his wits, he galloped off, dragging
the little house on wheels after him,
and roaring with pain, while the drivers
looked on, roaring with laughter.</p>

<span class="caption">THE MAD BULL.</span>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the little old man remained
standing on one leg, not daring
to open his eyes, for fear the charm
would be broken, and only wishing
that the little old woman were with
him. At last the house stopped,
moving with another jerk, that sent
the little old man toppling back in his
rocking chair, and a moment afterward
the door was opened a little bit,
and a strange voice said, "Well, here
we are at the village, old gentleman,
begging your pardon," and then all
was silent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Up jumped the little old man,
opening his eyes very wide this time,
hobbled to the door, and looked out.
There, sure enough, he was, in the
pleasant, shady village street, with
the church directly opposite, so nice
for Sundays, and nothing to be seen
but a drove of cows and oxen going
down the road at some distance!</p>

<p>"Well, was there ever anything
known like this?" cried Mr. Timmy
Timmens. "If this isn't the most
wonderful fairy doings I ever heard
of! I must go right off to find Polly,
and tell her the happy news."</p>

<p>So saying, he went down the
bright yellow steps, carefully shut the
bright blue door behind him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
toddled off as fast as he could to the
common.</p>

<p>Now the little old woman, before
she had finished digging up the potatuses,
found the sun very warm and
herself very sleepy, and thinking her
husband would be sure to call her
when twelve o'clock came, she just
got under the shade of the tomatuses,
and went off in a nice nap. When she
woke, she jumped up in a hurry, exclaiming,
"Why, bless me&mdash;how could
I have forgotten about twelve o'clock?
I must make haste into the house this
minute." But where was the house?
The little old woman stared all around
until she nearly stared her eyes out,
but it was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Why, my goodness gracious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
stars, and what's-his-names!" squealed
the little old woman, letting fall her
knife and basket; "where has the
house runned to? Timmy must have
tried the fairy charm without ever
telling me! I mean to go right to the
village and see if it is there."</p>

<p>So she gathered up her basket and
knife, stuffed the basket, and her
apron, and her pockets with all the
vegetables she could carry, and started
off for the village. Before she was
half way there, however, she met her
husband. "Where is it?" "There it
is!" they called at the same moment,
and falling into each other's arms and
a mud puddle, they stood for a long
time, saying by turns: "Did you
ever?" "No, I never!" "Would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
you believe it?" "Not 'less I see'd
it!" and then they took hold of hands
and trotted off to the little house that
ran on wheels.</p>

<p>There they found it, all high and
dry, under a big apple tree, looking as
nice as ninepence. With joyful hearts
they hurried inside, picked up the
saucepans, and cooked all the tomatuses
and potatuses for dinner, with
an apple dumpling for dessert, made
of some of the apples that had fallen
off the tree; and after that, the little
old man and the little old woman, and
the bright green blinds, and the bright
red walls, and the bright blue door
with the bright brass knocker, and the
bright yellow steps, all lived in peace
and the middle of the village, believing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
more firmly than ever in the existence
of fairies, and never doubting
that their house had been moved solely
by the miraculous power of the
fairy spell,</p>
